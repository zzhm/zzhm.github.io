Use this guide to find out what and how much to feed your child in the first year. The amounts are general recommendations only, so don't worry if your little one eats a bit more or less than suggested. It's always a good idea to discuss your plan for [starting solids](https://www.babycenter.com/404_do-i-need-to-introduce-solid-foods-to-my-baby-in-a-certain-o_10418662.bc) with your child’s doctor before getting started.

Also, you don't have to [introduce foods](https://www.babycenter.com/0_your-childs-feeding-timeline_10356968.bc) to your child in any special order. If you want to give your baby a taste of tofu at age 6 months, go ahead, even though it's not listed on our chart until age 8 months. And while cereal is a traditional first food in the United States, it's fine to start with mashed fruits or vegetables instead.

In most cases, you don't even have to wait to introduce highly allergenic foods like eggs, fish, and peanuts. (Read more about [food allergies](https://www.babycenter.com/0_food-allergies_12409.bc) and ask your doctor to be sure.)

## Age: 4 to 6 months

Signs of readiness for solid food

The following are some guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Your child is likely ready to try solids when he:

- Can [hold head up](https://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-milestones-head-control_6579.bc) and sit upright in highchair
- Shows significant weight gain (doubled birth weight) and weighs at least 13 pounds
- Can close mouth around a spoon
- Can move food from front to back of mouth

**What to feed**

- Breast milk or formula, PLUS
- Pureed vegetables (sweet potatoes, squash)
- Pureed fruit (apples, bananas, peaches)
- Pureed meat (chicken, pork, beef)
- Semi-liquid, iron-fortified cereal
- Small amounts of unsweetened yogurt (no cow's milk until age 1)

**How much per day**

- Begin with about 1 teaspoon pureed food or cereal. Mix cereal with 4 to 5 teaspoons breast milk or formula. (It will be very runny.)
- Increase to 1 tablespoon of pureed food, or 1 tablespoon of cereal mixed with breast milk or formula, twice a day. If you're giving cereal, gradually thicken the consistency by using less liquid.

**Feeding tips**

- If your baby won't eat what you offer the first time, try again in a few days.
- Introduce new foods one at a time. Wait two or three days, if possible, before offering another new food. (Wait three days if your baby or family has a history of allergies.) It's also a good idea to write down the foods your baby samples. If he has an adverse reaction, a food log will make it easier to pinpoint the cause.
- The order in which you introduce new foods doesn't usually matter. Your child's doctor can advise you.
