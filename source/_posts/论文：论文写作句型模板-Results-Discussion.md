结果和讨论部分是科技写作中最具有挑战性的部分之一。仔细规划这一部分非常重要，因为它可能包含大量需要以清晰简明的方式呈现的科学数据。 “结果”部分的目的是介绍研究的主要结果。结果和讨论可以合并为一个部分，也可以根据您提交研究论文的期刊的要求组织为单独的部分。使用小节和小标题来提高可读性和清晰度。使用描述性标题对所有表格和图片进行编号。以图表形式呈现结果，并在讨论结果时向读者指出相关项目。本部分应突出重要或有趣的发现以及统计测试的P值，同时要包含并突出论文的潜在局限性。

**研究论文的结果和讨论部分可能包括以下 6 大类内容，附上常用的写作模板：**

## 1. Findings

· From the short review above, key findings emerge: __

· We describe the results of __, which show __

· This suggests that __

· We showed that __

· Our findings on __ at least hint that __

· This is an important finding in the understanding of the __

· The present study confirmed the findings about __

· Another promising finding was that __

· Our results demonstrated that __

· This result highlights that little is known about the __

· A further novel finding is that __

· Together, the present findings confirm __

· The implications of these findings are discussed in __

· The results demonstrate two things.  First, __. Second,  __

· The results of the experiment found clear support for the __

· This analysis found evidence for __

· Planned comparisons revealed that __

· Our results casts a new light on __

· This section summarises the findings and contributions made.

· It performs well, giving good results.

· This gives clearly better results than __

· The results confirm that this a good choice for __

· From the results, it is clear that __

· In this section, we will illustrate some experimental results.

· This delivers significantly better results due to __

· The result now provides evidence to __

· It leads to good results, even if the improvement is negligible.

· This yields increasingly good results on data.

· The result of this analysis is then compared with the  __

· The applicability of these new results are then tested on __

· This is important to correctly interpret the results.

· The results are substantially better than __

· The results lead to similar conclusion where __

· Superior results are seen for __

· From these results it is clear that __

· Extensive results carried out show that this method improves __

· We obtain good results with this simple method.

· However, even better results are achieved when using our algorithm.

· It is worth discussing these interesting facts revealed by the results of  __

· Overall, our method was the one that obtained the most robust results.

· Slightly superior results are achieved with our algorithm.

· The result is equal to or better than a result that is currently accepted.

## 2. Comparison with prior studies

· The results demonstrated in this chapter match state of the art methods.

· Here we compare the results of the proposed method with those of the traditional methods.

· These results go beyond previous reports, showing that __

· In line with previous studies __

· This result ties well with previous studies wherein __

· Contrary to the findings of __ we did not find __

· They have demonstrated that __

· Others have shown that __ improves __

· By comparing the results from __, we hope to determine __

· However, in line with the ideas of __, it can be concluded that __

· When comparing our results to those of older studies, it must be pointed out that __

· We have verified that using __ produces similar results

· Overall these findings are in accordance with findings reported by __

· Even though we did not replicate the previously reported __, our results suggest that __

· A similar conclusion was reached by __

· However, when comparing our results to those of older studies, it must be pointed out __

· This is consistent with what has been found in previous __

· A similar pattern of results was obtained in __

· The findings are directly in line with previous findings

· These basic findings are consistent with research showing that __

· Other results were broadly in line with __

## 3. Limitations of your work

· Because of the lack of __ we decided to not investigate __

· One concern about the findings of __ was that __

· Because of this potential limitation, we treat __

· The limitations of the present studies naturally include __

· Regarding the limitations of __, it could be argued that __

· Another limitation of this __

· This limitation is apparent in many __

· Another limitation in __ involves the issue of __

· The main limitation is the lack of __

· One limitation is found in this case.

· One limitation of these methods however is that they __

· It presents some limitations such as __

· Although widely accepted, it suffers from some limitations due to __

· An apparent limitation of the method is __

· There are several limitations to this approach.

· One limitation of our implementation is that it is __

· A major source of limitation is due to  __

· The approach utilised suffers from the limitation that __

· The limitations are becoming clear __

· It suffers from the same limitations associated with a __

## 4. Casual arguments

· A popular explanation of __ is that __

· It is by now generally accepted that __

· A popular explanation is that __

· As it is not generally agreed that __

· These are very small and difficult to observe.

· It is important to highlight the fact that __

· It is notable that __

· An important question associated with __ is __

· This did not impair the __

· This is important because there is __

· This implies that __ is associated with __

· This is indicative for lack of __

· This will not be biased by __

· There were also some important differences in __

· It is interesting to note that, __

· It is unlikely that __

· This may alter or improve aspects of __

· In contrast, this makes it possible to __

· This is particularly important when investigating __

· This has been used to successfully account for __

· This introduces a possible confound in __

· This was included to verify that __

## 5. Speculations

· However, we acknowledge that there are considerable discussions among researchers as to __

· We speculate that this might be due to __

· There are reasons to doubt this explanation of __

· It remains unclear to which degree __ are attributed to __

· However, __ does seem to improve __

· This does seem to depend on __

· It is important to note, that the present evidence relies on __

· The results show that __ does not seem to impact the __

· However, the extent to which it is possible to __ is unknown

· Alternatively, it could simply mean that __

· It is difficult to explain such results within the context of __

· It is unclear whether this is a suitable for __

· This appears to be a case of __

· From this standpoint, __ can be considered as __

· To date, __remain unknown

· Under certain assumptions, this can be construed as __

· Because of this potential limitation, we treat __

· In addition, several questions remain unanswered.

· At this stage of understanding, we believe__

· Therefore, it remains unclear whether __

· This may explain why __

## 6. Deductive Arguments

· A difference between these __ can only be attributable to __

· Nonetheless, we believe that it is well justified to __

· This may raise concerns about __ which can be addressed by __

· As discussed, this is due to the fact that __

· Results demonstrate that this is not necessarily true.

· These findings support the notion that __ is not influenced by __

· This may be the reason why we did not find __

· In order to test whether this is equivalent across __, we __

· Therefore, __ can be considered to be equivalent for __
